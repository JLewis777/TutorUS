# Tutor Us

TutorUs is a restful API designed to connect you with virtual tutors that cater to your specific educational need.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
To begin using TutorUs there are necessary dependences from NPM that you must install. These are the following: 
- npm install express
- npm install axios
- npm install request
- npm install bodyParser
- npm install nodemon

## Running the application

To run this application, you must first start the server. 
- To start the server, type into the command prompt "nodemon index.js"
- To stop the server, use the keyboard shortcut "ctrl C"
- After successfully starting the server, type "localhost:3000" into your web browser. 


## Additional Notes
- After starting the server and pulling the application up, fill out the form with legitimate information. 
- Click the submit button, and you should be greeted with a new page confirming your appointment with the city, state, and name you have entered in.
- An external API will be determining your city and state from the zipcode you have entered in. 
- If the API KEY provided does not perform the request, visit (https://zipapi.us/dashboard/) and register a free account for 10 request uses.
